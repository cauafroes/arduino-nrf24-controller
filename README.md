# fabrincar

small project that consists on controlling an arduino based rc car from another arduino using nrf24 modules for low latency and relatively high range.

also includes a python car panel simulator with provided arduino code, wich displays info from the rc car on any pc, but i haven't written how to deploy the app yet because it isn't the easyest thing on the world to do, my bad
